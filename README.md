## Project Title: Reducing AUD Inpatient Alcohol Use with MCII: A Randomized Trial

**Techniques Used:**
- Experimental design
- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
- Single-blind study
- Descriptive statistics
- Independent-samples t-tests
- Repeated measures ANOVA
- Structured interviews for data collection

**Summary:**
Our research group aimed to reduce alcohol use among inpatients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) using Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII). A single-blind RCT with 122 participants was conducted. Key techniques used include descriptive statistics for initial data analysis, independent-samples t-tests to compare groups, and repeated measures ANOVA to assess changes over time. Structured interviews using the Timeline Follow Back method were employed for the measurement of alcohol consumption. This project demonstrates my proficiency in designing and executing clinical trials.
